# Door Listener

This is the code that is waiting to get a message from the DoorSensor, so it knows to send the message to the website that is open on your dekstop. When the sensor is tripped, an alert will pop up on the Door Listener website on your desktop.
## Devices

This code will run on a BeagleBone Black as well as a Raspberry Pi. I have only tried it on a BeagleBone, so let me know if any errors occur when using this code on a Raspberry Pi.
